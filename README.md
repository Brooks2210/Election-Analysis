# Overview of Election Audit:
#### The purpose of the election audit was to glean several key data points from the data. The election commission can easily find out who won the election, but they want to know 1) The voter turnout for each county, 2) The percentage of voters from each county out of the total count, and 3) The county with the highest turnout.
## Election-Audit Results: 
#### The following snapshot from the executed code offers shows the various aspects of the election that the election commission was interested in. Most notably we can see that Denver county had the largest turnout by far and that Dian DeGette not only won the election, but it was not even close. ![Election Results](https://github.com/Brooks2210/Election_Analysis/analysis/Results.PNG)
## Election-Audit Summary: 
#### In summary, the code developed to interpret the data from this election can easily be modified to review other elections or find new data that can be useful in the election commission allocating resources. One modification that can be done is sorting the candidates by political party. This information can then be used by the political parties to address voter registration efforts or determine what areas of a state need more of their attention. Another modification can be to import a political contribution data set and compare the number of votes for each candidate by the amount of money they have raised. Both modifications can use be based off the code already developed for the election commission.
